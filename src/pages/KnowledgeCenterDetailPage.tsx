Sustaining and advancing this performance while simultaneously executing one of the region's most ambitious digital transformation programmes requires a single, unified architecture discipline.\n\nThe DEWA Enterprise Architecture Strategy defines that discipline. It establishes the Corporate EA Office as the authoritative body governing all architecture decisions across DEWA's six operating divisions — Water Services, Electricity Generation, Electricity Networks, Customer Affairs, Digital DEWA, and Corporate Services. The strategy operationalises DEWA's status as an EA 4.0 practitioner — the highest recognised level of enterprise architecture maturity — and sets the trajectory for sustaining that maturity through the Digital Transformation Master Plan (DTMP) horizon of 2025–2030.\n\nAt its core, this strategy governs four strategic programmes simultaneously: the Digital DEWA initiative spanning Solar Power, Energy Storage, AI, and Digital Services; the AED 7 billion Smart Grid 2021–2035 programme; DEWA's Net-Zero 2050 commitment anchored by the 36% clean energy target by 2030 and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park (targeting 8,000 MW capacity); and the enterprise-wide transformation of customer service delivery through Rammas and Services 360.",

Data as a Strategic Asset — all solutions must comply with DEWA's enterprise data governance model; data must be accessible, governed, and reusable.\n5. Security by Design — cybersecurity controls (OT and IT) must be embedded at architecture stage, not retrofitted post-delivery.\n6. Sustainability Alignment — every architecture decision must be assessed against its carbon and energy impact in the context of Net-Zero 2050.\n7.

EA governs the technology architecture for renewable integration, grid connectivity, and performance monitoring.\n\n• Net-Zero 2050 Architecture — systematic alignment of all technology investment decisions with DEWA's clean energy commitments, including the 36% renewable target by 2030, hydrogen pilot programmes, and demand-side management platforms.\n\n• Rammas & Services 360 — AI-powered customer service platform with over 60 million interactions processed.
