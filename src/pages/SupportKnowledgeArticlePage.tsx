The 'lockout' state is often temporary and will reset after 60 minutes of no activity. However, if the underlying cause is a token mismatch, waiting will not resolve the issue. In these cases, verifying your device's date/time settings and ensuring the app is updated to the latest version are the first diagnostic steps.",

      "The DTMP VPN infrastructure uses GlobalProtect to provide a secure tunnel to enterprise resources. Instability usually manifests as session drops every 10-30 minutes. This is often due to 'tunnel flapping' where the client and gateway cannot agree on a consistent encryption state. Updating to the latest client version ensures you have the most resilient drivers. If you are working from a public network (like an airport or hotel), the network itself may be terminating the connection prematurely.",

If a recipient server cannot verify that our server is authorized to send for the domain (via SPF/DKIM), it will either delay, junk, or reject the mail. As we migrate to the DBP, many legacy systems still rely on old SMTP relays. Ensuring these systems are updated to use the modern mail infrastructure with proper authentication is critical for communications reliability.",

      "Analytics performance is vital for data-driven decision making. As our datasets grow, dashboards that once loaded instantly can become sluggish. The primary bottlenecks are 'Expensive Queries' that scan entire tables instead of using indexes. Performance tuning involves a mix of technical optimization (DAX/SQL tuning) and design choices (reducing visual density). Always aim for a 'Summary to Detail' design where the first page is lightweight and drill-throughs provide the deep data.",

      "BIOS updates frequently contain critical fan-curve adjustments following major OS updates.",
      "Software bloat can keep the CPU in a 'High Power' state even when the laptop is seemingly idle.",
    ],
    fullGuidance:
      "Thermal management is critical for hardware longevity and consistent performance. When a CPU reaches its thermal limit (usually 95-100°C), it 'throttles' by lowering its speed, which users perceive as lag. If throttling cannot keep the temperature safe, the device will perform a 'Hard Shutdown' to protect components. Regular maintenance and mindful software management are essential, especially as laptops age and thermal paste can dry out.",
    whyThisMatters:
      "Hardware downtime disrupts productivity. A laptop that shuts down during a business-critical DBP presentation or deployment window creates immediate operational risk.",
    signalsToWatch:

      "SSO requires tight time synchronization between your local machine and the identity provider.",
      "Using Incognito mode is the fastest way to isolate whether the issue is browser-specific.",
    ],
    fullGuidance:
      "ServiceNow uses SAML 2.0 for Single Sign-On (SSO). The process involves a redirect from ServiceNow to our Identity Provider (Azure AD) and back. A 'login loop' occurs when the redirect fails to satisfy the requirement of either side, often because a cookie says the user is logged in, but the session is actually expired. Refreshing the browser state is the first and most effective fix for 90% of SSO issues.",

If this code doesn't arrive, it's usually due to stale profile data or a delivery issue with the telecommunications provider. This article guides you through the common 'dead ends' in the verification process. Remember that the security of our environment relies on these codes; they are only sent to verified channels registered annually during our security audit.",
    whyThisMatters:
      "When SSPR fails, it forces a manual support intervention. Every failed self-service attempt increases the Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for access-related issues.",
